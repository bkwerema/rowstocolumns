# rowstocolumns
The purpose of this project is to convert data in an excel sheet from rows to columns using Python. The intention is to retain some data in row format and have data in a particular column show up in multiple columns.

This simple code was developed to ease a repetitive task at work whereby the data extracted from SQL had to be converted this way. This can also be done in SQL, however, the Python script is a few lines compared to various lines of SQL.
